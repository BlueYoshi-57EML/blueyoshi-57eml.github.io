"you have one unheared message. first unread message."<br>
<br>
open eyes, they can't disguise<br>
the <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gew9YZBXUAAY2xd.jpg?name=small" style="font-family: Music Hall;">new color</a><a style="font-family: Music Hall;"> etched into my mind along with mr. smith<br>
he sits there, so patiently<br>
a life ended soon with broken nails and the mirror's frame i never see<br><br>
<center>
it seems so fine<br>
if it were mine<br>
i would own most nothing<br>
it seems so fine<br>
if it were mine<br>
the world is for me<br>
it seems so fine<br>
if it were mine<br>
i would own most nothing<br>
it seems so fine<br>
if it were mine<br>
the world is for me<br><br>
i've found my love</center><br>
if i could wash the world away<br>
would i begin  to live that way?<br>
if i could wash the world away<br>
would i begin  to live that way?<br>
and though they say it's poisonous<br>
their bath does wash their pain away!<br>
their bath does wash their pain away<br><br>
childhood could see the ruffles of<br>
paper, useless things<br>
watch them buy that shiny<br>
thing that makes my daddy<br>
smile... smile...<br><br>
waiting all week<br>
one day it's mine<br>
crying halts to nothing<br>
the joy that i seek<br>
i've... found... my... love<br><br>
i want<br>
an eternity<br>
so long as i<br>
can brush away my grief<br>
my grief...<br>
<p style="text-align: end;">my grief.<br>
my Grief<br>
myyyy griieeeeef!<br>
grief?</p><br>
My grief!!!!!!!!<br><br>
open eyes, they can't disguise<br>
the new color etched into my mind along with mr. smith<br>
he sits there, so patiently<br>
a life ended soon with broken nails and the mirror's frame i never see<br><br>
<center>
it seems so fine<br>
if it were mine<br>
i would own most nothing<br>
it seems so fine<br>
if it were mine<br>
the world is for me<br>
it seems so fine<br>
if it were mine<br>
i would own most nothing<br>
it seems so fine<br>
if it were mine<br>
the world is for me<br><br>
i've found my love</center><br>
