john<br>
the little boy from south taiwan<br>
is brought to us against his will<br>
he fits right in, he does<br><br>
john<br>
he took so long to under-Stand!<br>
For a good bedtime that he'd go for nine cutoffs!<br>
They probably killed them, break up they're coming down!<br>
I rub a curtain they grow like a tub again!<br>
Or send a mechanic to break him a nugget!<br>
oh?<br><br>
how<br>
mom and dad can love him though<br>
their skin and hair don't really match<br>
that's why when it comes to white socks<br>
no better than tide action with -Bleach!<br>
Fill the measuring cup to the first line marked<br>
"1" for moderate loads with clothes of white color!<br>
Or fill the measuring cup to the second line marked<br>
"2" for heavy loads that are out of your reach!<br><br>
<center>john<br>
turn to the sun and finally awake<br>
prisons<br>
turned a noble act of welcoming<br>
rotten</center><br>
order<br>
within the next fifteen minutes<br>
and you'll reciever not one but two<br>
children who love to hold you<br>
that's why they sponsor the -Olympics!<br>
If we had a good time breaking it up will love now!<br>
Would you like a toboggan? i could hang up but let her go!<br>
Fall rub it, get down, they had to write over for her!<br>
Chew drop it god, to the vatican gold!<br><br>
<center>john<br>
turn to the sun and finally awake<br>
prisons<br>
turned a noble act of welcoming<br>
rotten</center><br>
there's the motivation<br>
flashing colors and packaged deals<br>
our folk<br>
aren't enough...<br><br>
