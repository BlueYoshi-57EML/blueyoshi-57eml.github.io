take your ruined scalp and turn it back the way you found it<br>
afraid to do it? come on try<br>
try to lie falling down<br>
walking down the aisle being passive to your weak mates<br>
shaking around, never sure of where the carpet terminates<br>
puff out that chest, expect one who loves<br>
nadie arreglará su pelo<br>
saçının esirisin<br>
can't find try to solo, think, lay low<br><br><center>
try to run away against the wind that takes you to a different<br>
state of mine upright your Spine!<br>
afraid to admit your blackness fall down<br>
that hill that always made you cry<br><br></center><center>
